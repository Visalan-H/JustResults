# Browser Extension: Efficient Data Extraction & Request Blocking

## Overview

This browser extension optimizes web performance by blocking unnecessary requests and extracting only essential data. It is designed to improve speed, reduce network load, and automate data retrieval efficiently.

## Features

- Blocks unnecessary requests such as CSS, images, fonts, and unneeded JavaScript.
- Sends a custom request with a payload to retrieve only essential data.
- Converts the received JSON response into an HTML file that downloads automatically.
- Closes the results page and redirects to the downloads folder, reducing the overall page load and improving efficiency.

## Performance Improvements

We have included images showing performance before and after using the extension, along with an example output HTML file displaying last semester's marks.
